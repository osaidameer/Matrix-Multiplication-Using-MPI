# Matrix-Multiplication-Using-MPI
Blocking and Non-Blocking multiplication of matrices using MPI in C

Involves reading the dimensions of a number of matrices from a file and multiplying them using both blocking and non-blocking MPI calls. There must be between 5-7 matrices, the dimensions should be between 20-50 and the dimensions should be unique.
